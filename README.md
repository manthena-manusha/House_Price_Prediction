# House_Price_Prediction
Machine Learning project for predicting house prices

Project Overview:
This project predicts house prices using machine learning based on property features such as area, rooms, and amenities.

Problem Statement:
Build a regression model to accurately predict house prices from housing data.

Dataset Explanation:
The dataset includes features like:
area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories
parking, furnishing status
amenities (air conditioning, basement, etc.)
Target: price

ML Models Used:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor

Evaluation Metric:
R² Score – Measures how well the model explains price variations.
Higher R² = better model.

How to Run:
Clone the repository
Install dependencies
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook

Output / Results:
Data preprocessed and encoded
Models trained and compared
Ensemble models performed better than Linear Regression
